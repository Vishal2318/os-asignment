Simulation based assignment  NAME: Vishal bhatia REG: 11815422 ROLL: A-32 OPERATING SYSTEM FACULTY NAME: Shivali chopra LOVELY PROFESSIONAL UNIVERSITY  Q.6 Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use nonpreemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made. Process Arrival Time Burst Time P1 0.0 8 P2 0.4 4 P3 1.0 1 a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm? b. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm? c. Compute what average turnaround time will be if the CPU is left idle for the first 1 unit and then SJF scheduling is used. Remember that processes P1 and P2 are waiting during this idle time, so their waiting time may increase.  Q.21 A number of cats and mice inhabit a house. The cats and mice have worked out a deal where the mice can steal pieces of the catsâ€™ food, so long as the cats never see the mice actually doing so. If the cats see the mice, then the cats must eat the mice (or else lose face with all of their cat friends). There are NumBowls cat food dishes, NumCats cats, and NumMice mice. Your job is to synchronize the cats and mice so that the following requirements are satisfied:  No mouse should ever get eaten. You should assume that if a cat is eating at a food d
